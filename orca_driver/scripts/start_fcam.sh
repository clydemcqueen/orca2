# gstreamer notes:
#
# v4l2src pulls data from the camera
#   pulled from video1, which is h264 encoded on the BlueRobotics USB camera
#   do-timestamp=true means that the camera provides a timestamp
#
# queue provides a producer/consumer buffer, and makes sure that the producer (v4l2src)
# and consumer (capsfilter and downstream) are on different threads
#
# There’s an implied “capsfilter caps=” in the next step.
# This set of caps specifies width, height and framerate, the other caps are negotiated.
#
# h264parse parses the h264 stream and provides additional caps downstream. In this case it provides these caps:
#   stream-format=(string)byte-stream, alignment=(string)au, pixel-aspect-ratio=(fraction)1/1, colorimetry=(string)2:4:7:1, interlace-mode=(string)progressive
#
# rtph264pay encodes h264 into RTP packets
#   config-interval=10 sends SPS and PPS packets every 10s, use -1 to send every IDR frame (whatever that is).
#   10, 1 and -1 all seem to work fine. I picked 10s for now.
#
# With these settings gst-launch is consuming ~13% CPU on the UP board and sending data at 1.4Mbps
