ROV and AUV functionality for [Orca2](https://github.com/clydemcqueen/orca2).

Modes:
* disarmed: thrusters are off, all joystick buttons except "arm" are ignored
* manual: thrusters are manually controlled
* hold_h: the autopilot controls heading
* hold_d: the autopilot controls depth
* hold_hd: the autopilot controls heading and depth
* mission (AUV mode): the autopilot is running a mission, and will switch to manual when complete

Orca will enter an "sos" mode if a leak or low battery condition is detected.
In this mode the thrusters are off, the joystick is ignored, and the lights and radios are calling for help.

Orca supports tethered and untethered operation:
* Orca will disarm if topside communication is lost, except when running a mission
* if you run without a tether, make sure the vehicle is positively buoyant!

World coordinate frame is ENU (East, North, Up).
This is the default used by ROS and Gazebo.

Forces that we model:
* gravity
* buoyancy
* thruster translation forces
* thruster moments are not modeled (vehicle is designed to cancel thruster moments)
* vehicle drag
* tether drag is not modeled

Control inputs (world frame):
* u_x
* u_y
* u_z
* u_yaw

Control outputs (world frame):
* x_dot_dot
* y_dot_dot
* z_dot_dot
* yaw_dot_dot

Constants:
* m: mass of vehicle
* g: 9.81 m/s^2
* b: buoyancy (weight of displaced water)
* c_drag_xy: drag coefficient for x and y motion
* c_drag_z: drag coefficient for z motion
* c_drag_yaw: drag coefficient for yaw motion

Motion equations:
* x_dot_dot = u_x / m * cos(yaw) - c_drag_xy * x_dot ^ 2
* y_dot_dot = u_y / m * sin(yaw) - c_drag_xy * y_dot ^ 2
* z_dot_dot = u_z / m - c_drag_z * z_dot ^ 2 - g + b
* yaw_dot_dot = u_yaw / inertia - c_drag_yaw * yaw_dot ^ 2
* roll_dot_dot = 0
* pitch_dot_dot = 0
